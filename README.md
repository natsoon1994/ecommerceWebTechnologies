# Overview
This project is an attempt to build an ecommerce store leveraging a combination of available SaaS web technologies.

## Context
The intentions behind this project are:
1. A first step into building ecommerce stores and abstracting certain ecommerce functionality to interesting SaaS technologies outside of the more well-known Shopify/Woocommerce options.
2. A starting template that can be refactored to explore leveraging other SaaS tools or building features from scratch in the future.
3. A project that can be used as a base for down-the-line business operation/process automation/marketing automation SaaS and data analytics tools which are more up my alley as someone in Marketing Technology.
